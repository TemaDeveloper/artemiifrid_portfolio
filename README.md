## 🌐 Deployment with GitHub Pages & Actions

This project is configured for easy, automated deployment using GitHub Actions.

### How It Works

The workflow file located at `.github/workflows/main.yml` will automatically build and deploy your site to the `main` branch of your repository whenever you push a change to the `main` branch. GitHub Pages then serves the website from that branch.

### Setup Instructions

1.  **Push to Your Own Repository:** After cloning, make sure to create your own new repository on GitHub and push the code to it.
2.  **Enable GitHub Pages:**
    * In your new repository, go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
    * Under "Build and deployment", select the **Source** as **GitHub Actions**.
